# TP4 - Hypothesis Testing in R üìäüîç

## Overview
This repository contains our solution for TP4 of the Statistical Inference course. In this project, we implement and analyze hypothesis tests in R to determine if Provider A's chickens are contaminated (i.e., if their mean arsenic concentration is greater than 80 ppb). The analysis includes formulating the hypothesis test, running simulations, and applying the test to observed data. The final deliverable is an R Markdown report compiled to PDF.

## Project Description
The main objective is to test whether the average arsenic concentration (¬µ) in Provider A's chickens exceeds 80 ppb. Our analysis involves:

1. **Formulating the Hypothesis Test:**
   - **Parameter of Interest:** The mean arsenic concentration (¬µ) in chickens.
   - **Hypotheses:**  
     - Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): ¬µ = 80  
     - Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): ¬µ > 80  
   - **Test Level:** Œ± = 0.10 (10% risk of wrongly canceling the supplier)
   - **Test Statistic:**  
     \[
     T = \frac{\bar{X} - 80}{\sqrt{16/n}}
     \]
     Under H‚ÇÄ, T follows a standard normal distribution, N(0, 1).
   - **Rejection Region:** Reject H‚ÇÄ if \( T > 1.281552 \).

2. **Simulation and Analysis:**
   - Generate sample data using a normal distribution \( N(80, 16) \) for a sample size of 5.
   - Compute the test statistic for the sample.
   - Implement a function `estadistico` in R to calculate the test statistic.
   - Run a Monte Carlo simulation (Nrep = 10,000) under H‚ÇÄ and under H‚ÇÅ (with ¬µ = 84) to study the distribution of the test statistic.
   - Create density histograms with the standard normal density curve superimposed.
   - Estimate the proportion of samples that reject H‚ÇÄ and verify if it approximates the significance level.

3. **Real Data Application:**
   - Compute the p-value for an observed sample of arsenic concentrations.
   - Make decisions at significance levels of 0.05 and 0.10 based on the p-value.
   - Propose and implement a simulation to validate the p-value estimate.
